				<h1>Welcome To MoViE TiMe</h1>
				<p>
					MoViE TiMe is a multi-platform, free software BitTorrent client that includes an integrated media player. The application provides
					a free alternative to subscription-based video streaming services such as Netflix. MoViE TiMe uses sequential downloading to stream
					video listed by several torrent websites, and third party trackers can also be added manually. The legality of the software depends 
					on the jurisdiction.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>Following its creation, MoViE TiMe quickly received positive media attention, with some comparing the app to Netflix for its
					ease of use. After this increase in popularity, the program was abruptly taken down by its original developers on March 14, 2014,
						due to pressure from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA).[4] Since then, the program has been forked several times 
						with several other development teams such as Time4Popcorn and the Butter Project to maintain the program and produce new features. 
						Time4Popcorn reportedly gained millions of users within four months of launching in 2014 and became the first fork to bring 
						MoViE TiMe to Android devices.[5] In September of 2014, Time4Popcorn became available on jailbroken Apple devices, and eventually 
						non-jailbroken iOS devices via a Windows installation tool
